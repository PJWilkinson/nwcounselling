# Grief & Bereavement: A Comprehensive Guide

Grief is the natural response to loss. It's not a problem to be solved or a phase to get through quickly—it's a process of adjusting to a world that has fundamentally changed.

## What is grief?

Grief is our response to losing someone or something important to us. While we often associate grief with death, it can follow any significant loss:

- Death of a loved one
- End of a relationship or friendship
- Loss of health or physical ability
- Loss of a job, career, or role
- Loss of a home or community
- Loss of a future you expected
- Loss of identity or sense of self

Grief is universal, yet every grief is unique. How you grieve depends on who you lost, your relationship with them, your circumstances, your history, and countless other factors.

## There is no "right" way to grieve

You may have heard of the "stages of grief"—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. While these concepts can be helpful, they're often misunderstood.

**Grief isn't linear.** You won't move neatly through stages. You might feel acceptance one day and raw denial the next. Both are normal.

**There's no timeline.** Grief doesn't follow a schedule. Some people feel better after months; others carry significant grief for years. Both are normal.

**Grief looks different for everyone.** Some people cry constantly; others feel numb. Some want to talk; others withdraw. Some need activity; others need stillness. There's no right way.

**Mixed feelings are common.** You can feel relief and guilt, love and anger, gratitude and devastation—sometimes simultaneously. Grief isn't simple.

## How grief affects us

Grief touches every aspect of our being:

### Emotionally
- Sadness, longing, yearning
- Anger—at the person who died, at circumstances, at yourself
- Guilt—about things said or unsaid, done or not done
- Anxiety about the future or your own mortality
- Relief (especially after prolonged illness)—often followed by guilt about the relief
- Numbness or feeling emotionally flat

### Physically
- Exhaustion and fatigue
- Sleep difficulties—too much or too little
- Appetite changes
- Physical aches and pains
- Lowered immunity
- Feeling like your body isn't quite yours

### Cognitively
- Difficulty concentrating
- Forgetfulness
- Confusion or feeling disoriented
- Preoccupation with the loss
- Searching for meaning

### Behaviourally
- Withdrawing from others
- Avoiding reminders—or seeking them out
- Changes in activity levels
- Taking care of "business" while feeling disconnected from it
- Searching for the person in familiar places

### Spiritually
- Questioning beliefs about life, death, and meaning
- Feeling disconnected from faith or spiritual practices
- Searching for connection with the person who died
- Asking "why?"

## Complicated grief

Most people find their grief becomes more manageable over time, even if it never fully disappears. But sometimes grief becomes stuck or overwhelming:

**Prolonged grief disorder** may be present when, after many months or years:
- The pain remains as intense as the early days
- You're unable to accept the loss as real
- Life feels meaningless without the person
- You're unable to engage with normal activities
- You feel you've lost a part of yourself

**Complicated grief** can also result from:
- The nature of the death (sudden, traumatic, suicide)
- Difficult relationships with the person who died
- Multiple losses in a short time
- Lack of support or unacknowledged grief
- Previous experiences of loss or trauma

If your grief feels stuck or is significantly affecting your ability to function, professional support can help.

## Disenfranchised grief

Some losses are harder to talk about because society doesn't fully recognise or validate them:

- Loss of a pregnancy or fertility
- Loss of a pet
- Death of an ex-partner
- Loss of someone to suicide or addiction
- Anticipatory grief while someone is still alive
- Loss of a relationship to dementia

This "disenfranchised grief" can be especially isolating. Your pain is real, even if others don't fully understand or acknowledge it.

## Supporting yourself through grief

There's no formula for grieving well, but some things often help:

**Let yourself grieve.** There's no shortcut around grief—only through it. Allow yourself to feel whatever arises without judgment.

**Accept that grief takes time.** Be patient with yourself. Healing isn't linear, and setbacks are normal.

**Take care of your physical needs.** Sleep, eat, move your body when you can. Grief is exhausting, and your body needs support.

**Connect with others.** Even if you want to withdraw, maintaining some connection helps. Let trusted people know what you need—whether that's company or space.

**Create rituals.** Ways of remembering and honouring the person or what you've lost can be comforting. This might be simple or elaborate.

**Limit expectations.** You don't have to "be strong" or "move on" on anyone else's timeline. Do what you can; let the rest wait.

## How counselling can help

Grief counselling offers:

**A space to feel.** Sometimes you need to express feelings you're protecting others from, or that feel too big to contain alone.

**Witness and validation.** Having someone fully present with your grief—without trying to fix it or rush you through it—is powerful.

**Help with complicated grief.** If grief is stuck or overwhelming, therapeutic approaches can help you process what's blocking you.

**Working with the relationship.** Grief often brings up unfinished business with the person who died. Counselling can help you work with these feelings.

**Finding your way forward.** Eventually, grief becomes about integrating the loss into your life—carrying it with you rather than being trapped by it.

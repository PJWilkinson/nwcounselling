# Working Through Trauma: A Comprehensive Guide

Trauma is what happens when an experience overwhelms our capacity to cope. It's not about what happened being "bad enough"—it's about how the experience affected you and whether it continues to affect you now.

## What is trauma?

Trauma isn't just about dramatic events. It can result from:

**Single incident trauma:** A one-time event like an accident, assault, sudden loss, or witnessing something distressing.

**Complex trauma:** Repeated or prolonged experiences, often in childhood, such as ongoing abuse, neglect, or living with domestic violence.

**Developmental trauma:** Disruptions to healthy attachment in early life—emotional neglect, inconsistent caregiving, or not having your needs met.

**Relational trauma:** Harm that happens within relationships, including betrayal, manipulation, or emotional abuse.

**Medical trauma:** Frightening medical experiences, procedures, or diagnoses.

**Vicarious trauma:** Absorbing trauma from hearing others' experiences, common in helping professions or caring for traumatised loved ones.

Trauma is defined by its impact, not by meeting some threshold of severity. If an experience continues to affect how you feel, think, or function, it matters.

## How trauma affects us

Trauma doesn't just stay in the past—it shapes how we experience the present. This happens because trauma affects the brain and nervous system:

### The body keeps the score

Your nervous system may remain on high alert long after the danger has passed. This looks like:
- Hypervigilance—constantly scanning for threat
- Startle responses to sudden sounds or movements
- Difficulty relaxing or feeling safe
- Physical tension, pain, or illness with no clear medical cause
- Exhaustion from being perpetually activated

### Intrusive symptoms

The past breaks into the present through:
- Flashbacks—feeling like the trauma is happening now
- Nightmares or disturbed sleep
- Intrusive thoughts or images
- Emotional reactions triggered by reminders (sounds, smells, situations)

### Avoidance

To manage the pain, we often avoid:
- Places, people, or situations that remind us of the trauma
- Thoughts or feelings connected to what happened
- Talking about the experience
- Anything that might trigger distress

Avoidance provides short-term relief but often keeps trauma stuck.

### Changes in how we see ourselves and the world

Trauma can shift our fundamental beliefs:
- "I'm not safe"
- "I can't trust anyone"
- "It was my fault"
- "I'm damaged"
- "Bad things always happen"

These beliefs feel like facts, but they're responses to what happened—not truths about who you are or what's possible.

## Trauma and relationships

Trauma, especially relational or childhood trauma, shapes how we connect with others:

- **Difficulty trusting:** Even people who haven't hurt you may feel dangerous
- **Fear of abandonment:** Hypervigilance about being left or rejected
- **People-pleasing:** Sacrificing your needs to maintain relationships
- **Withdrawal:** Avoiding closeness to protect yourself
- **Repetition:** Finding yourself in relationships that echo past dynamics

These patterns make sense as adaptations to what you experienced. They protected you once, even if they create problems now.

## What helps with trauma?

Healing from trauma is possible. The brain and nervous system can change—with time, safety, and often support.

### Safety first

Trauma recovery begins with establishing safety—in your external environment and internal experience. You can't process trauma while still in survival mode.

### Going at your pace

Trauma therapy isn't about diving into the worst memories immediately. A skilled therapist will help you build resources and stability first. The goal is to process trauma without becoming overwhelmed.

### Processing the experience

This might involve:
- Telling your story in a safe space
- Working with memories in structured ways
- Understanding how trauma affected your beliefs and behaviours
- Connecting present-day reactions to past experiences

### Body-based work

Because trauma lives in the nervous system, approaches that work with the body can be helpful:
- Learning to notice and regulate your physical state
- Understanding your window of tolerance
- Practices that help the nervous system feel safe

### Rebuilding connection

Healing often involves learning to trust again—yourself, others, and the possibility of safety.

## How counselling can help

Trauma-informed counselling provides:

**A safe relationship:** Possibly the first truly safe relationship you've experienced. This in itself can be healing.

**Understanding what happened:** Making sense of your experiences and responses without judgment.

**Processing at your pace:** Working with traumatic material in ways that don't overwhelm your system.

**Reconnecting with yourself:** Trauma often creates disconnection from your body, emotions, and identity. Therapy can help rebuild these connections.

**Changing trauma-based beliefs:** Recognising the difference between what trauma taught you and what's actually true.

**Building resilience:** Developing resources to manage triggers and live more fully in the present.

## When to seek help

Consider reaching out if:
- Past experiences continue to affect your daily life
- You have nightmares, flashbacks, or intrusive memories
- You avoid people, places, or activities because of what happened
- You feel numb, disconnected, or unable to experience positive emotions
- Relationships are difficult because of trust or intimacy issues
- You use alcohol, drugs, or other behaviours to manage difficult feelings
- You feel fundamentally unsafe or damaged

You don't need to be in crisis to benefit from support. And you don't need to relive the worst moments to begin healing.

# Understanding Autism: A Comprehensive Guide

Autism is a neurological difference that affects how people experience and interact with the world. It's a spectrum condition, meaning autistic people vary enormously in their experiences, strengths, and challenges. For many adults, autism goes unrecognised until later in life—especially for those who've learned to mask their differences.

## What is autism?

Autism affects:
- **Social communication:** How we interpret social cues, process verbal and non-verbal information, and express ourselves
- **Sensory processing:** How we experience sounds, lights, textures, smells, and other sensory input
- **Thinking patterns:** Often characterised by detail-focused processing, pattern recognition, and deep interests
- **Predictability needs:** A preference for routine and difficulty with unexpected changes

Autism is not a disease or disorder to be cured. It's a different way of being human—one with genuine strengths as well as real challenges in a world designed primarily for neurotypical people.

## Late diagnosis: a growing recognition

Many adults are discovering they're autistic in their 30s, 40s, 50s, or beyond. This happens for several reasons:

**Historical understanding was limited:** Until recently, autism was associated with very specific presentations—often non-speaking children with visible support needs. Many autistic people don't match this stereotype.

**Women and girls were overlooked:** Autism research focused primarily on boys, missing how autism commonly presents in girls and women. Many women were misdiagnosed with anxiety, depression, or personality disorders.

**Masking hides the signs:** Many autistic people learn to camouflage their differences—studying social rules, copying neurotypical behaviour, suppressing natural responses. This exhausting process can be so effective that autism goes undetected.

**Co-occurring conditions took focus:** When anxiety, depression, or burnout became severe, those symptoms were treated without recognising the underlying autism.

## Discovering you're autistic as an adult

A late autism discovery is often triggered by:
- Encountering autistic content online and recognising yourself
- Having a child diagnosed and seeing similarities
- Burnout or mental health crisis that prompts deeper investigation
- A therapist or doctor raising the possibility

The realisation can bring a complex mix of emotions:

**Relief:** Finally, things make sense. You're not broken—you're autistic.

**Grief:** For the years of struggling without understanding. For the support you didn't receive. For the version of yourself that might have thrived with earlier recognition.

**Anger:** At being missed, misdiagnosed, or misunderstood. At a world that expects everyone to function the same way.

**Confusion:** About what this means for your identity, relationships, and future.

**Validation:** Your experiences were real. Your struggles were real. You're not making it up.

## How autism affects daily life

Autism touches every aspect of existence, though the specifics vary enormously between individuals:

### Sensory experience
- Overwhelm from sounds, lights, crowds, or textures
- Strong preferences for specific sensory inputs
- Difficulty in environments others find comfortable
- Need for recovery time after sensory-demanding experiences

### Social interaction
- Exhaustion from social situations, even enjoyable ones
- Difficulty reading between the lines or detecting subtext
- Preferring direct, clear communication
- Finding small talk draining or confusing
- Deep connections with a few people rather than many superficial ones

### Work and daily functioning
- Excelling in areas of interest while struggling with "basic" tasks
- Needing routines and predictability to function
- Difficulty with open-ended instructions or vague expectations
- Burnout from sustained masking in professional environments

### Identity and self-understanding
- Feeling fundamentally different from others
- Not fitting neatly into social groups or expectations
- A lifetime of trying to be someone you're not

## Masking and its costs

Masking (or camouflaging) refers to the conscious or unconscious suppression of autistic traits to appear more neurotypical. This might include:

- Forcing eye contact despite discomfort
- Scripting conversations and rehearsing responses
- Suppressing stimming (self-stimulatory movements)
- Copying others' social behaviours
- Hiding overwhelm or distress

Masking is often a survival strategy—a way to avoid bullying, exclusion, or professional consequences. But it comes at a significant cost:

**Exhaustion:** Maintaining a performance is draining. Many autistic adults experience chronic fatigue.

**Identity confusion:** When you spend decades performing as someone else, you may lose touch with who you actually are.

**Delayed breakdown:** Masking can hold things together for years, until it can't. Autistic burnout is common, often severe, and can be triggered by life changes or accumulated stress.

**Mental health impact:** High rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidality in autistic adults are linked partly to the stress of masking.

## Relationships and connection

Autistic people form deep, meaningful relationships—but the dynamics may differ from neurotypical expectations:

- **Quality over quantity:** Preferring a few close connections to many casual ones
- **Different expressions of care:** Showing love through actions, shared interests, or practical help rather than expected social gestures
- **Communication differences:** Needing explicit communication; struggling with hints or unspoken expectations
- **Intensity:** Passionate interest in people, not disinterest, but expressed differently

Relationships can be complicated by neurotypical partners or friends not understanding autistic needs, or by the autistic person masking so heavily that their needs become invisible.

## How counselling can help

Counselling with an autism-aware therapist can support:

**Processing your identity:** Whether newly discovered or long-known, there's often complex feelings about being autistic in a neurotypical world.

**Understanding yourself:** Separating who you really are from the masks you've worn. Reconnecting with authentic needs and preferences.

**Reducing shame:** Many autistic people carry deep shame about their differences. Therapy can help recognise these differences as neutral or positive.

**Managing mental health:** Addressing anxiety, depression, or trauma that often accompanies autism.

**Navigating relationships:** Understanding your communication style and needs, and how to express them.

**Burnout recovery:** If you've hit a wall, counselling can support gradual recovery and building a more sustainable life.

## Finding the right support

When seeking support as an autistic adult, consider:

- **Autism-aware professionals:** Not all therapists understand autism. Look for those with specific training or lived experience.
- **Your communication preferences:** Some autistic people prefer written communication, structured sessions, or specific therapeutic approaches.
- **The environment:** Sensory aspects of the therapy space matter. Online therapy can work well for many autistic clients.
- **Pace and style:** You may need more time to process, or prefer directness over open-ended exploration.
